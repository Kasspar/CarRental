Car Rental System – Technical Assessment

This repository contains a small, simulated Car Rental System implemented using clean object-oriented design and validated with unit tests.
The project was created as part of a time-boxed technical assessment (approx. 2 hours).

The focus of the solution is:

clear domain modelling

correct business logic

test-driven validation

simplicity and readability

No frameworks or databases were used, as the assignment emphasizes OOP fundamentals rather than infrastructure.
